# Index Your Documentation

Point Snipara at your markdown files and it will index them for instant semantic search.

**Supported formats:** `.md`, `.mdx`, `.txt`

**Two ways to index:**

1. **Auto-detect** — Snipara scans your workspace and offers to index found docs
2. **Manual sync** — Click **Sync Documents** below or right-click any markdown file in the Explorer

Once indexed, your documentation is chunked, embedded, and ready for sub-second queries. Updates are incremental — only changed files are re-processed.
